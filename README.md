# 🧬 Comparative Analysis of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Breast Cancer Identification Using Deep Learning

This project compares the performance of different **dimensionality reduction** techniques and their **hybrid combinations** with **Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAE)** to predict breast cancer from gene expression data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To evaluate how different dimensionality reduction methods affect the performance of deep learning models for breast cancer classification, using gene expression features.

---

## 📚 Techniques Compared

### 🔹 Dimensionality Reduction Methods
- **FS** (Feature Selection)
- **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis)
- **KPCA** (Kernel PCA)
- **RP** (Random Projection)

### 🔸 Deep Learning + Dimensionality Reduction Hybrids
- **SDAE**
- **SDAE + FS**
- **SDAE + PCA**
- **SDAE + KPCA**
- **SDAE + RP**
